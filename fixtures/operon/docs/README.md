# Operon

An **org runtime**: a standing team of AI agents (Planner, Builder, Reviewer,
SRE, Support, Marketing) that develops and operates a software product through
a private GitHub repo, with a human approver gating critical operations only.

```

The flow is a single loop, read top to bottom: the **Timer tick** wakes the
**Dispatcher**, which turns due work into one durable episode plan before any
delivery turn reaches an adapter, then the
`↻ Next tick` node folds back to the Dispatcher on the following tick — grants
and freshly-polled GitHub events are both picked up there.

EpisodePlanner normally runs for every episode in both assignment modes. The
only provider-planning-turn bypass is an explicit, provenance-bearing creator
scope complete enough to normalize into the same executable plan. A short
prompt, an existing ticket, or work that merely looks simple never implies the
bypass. `fixed` and `adaptive` change only how each planned provider step gets
its indivisible harness/model/effort assignment: fixed resolves the configured
tuple; adaptive chooses an exact approved candidate. Role permissions do not
change with the assignment. The planner boot turn receives no network or tool
authority; deterministic intent gathering is complete before it runs.

The gate classifies *every* tool action; only ops matching a critical rule are
blocked. A blocked op does not resume in place — the turn ends `blocked_on_gate`,
the human's grant writes a single-use grant file, and the **next dispatcher tick
re-runs that turn first**, where the gate now finds the grant and lets the op
through. The org's own squash-merge is a separate path, gated by HMAC review
authorization rather than this gate.

Read [`docs/PURPOSE.md`](docs/PURPOSE.md) for the why and every decision made so far;
[`TASTE.md`](TASTE.md) is the org's constitution;
[`roles.yaml`](roles.yaml) is the org chart made executable;
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the contributor map.
New to the code? Start at [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) —
the thin system map — and follow its links into each subsystem's topic folder
(`docs/loop/`, `docs/scheduler/`, `docs/approvals/`, `docs/harness/`,
`docs/org/`, and friends), where one `design.md` per folder is the
authoritative contract.

Operon turns approved goals into verified software outcomes with process
proportional to the work and its risk, minimal human attention, durable forward
progress, and continuously improving unit economics. `docs/VISION.md` states
the operator outcome; `docs/episodes/contract.md` is the normative plan-derived
budget, route, and measurement contract; `docs/qualification/design.md`
owns qualification and release gating.

## Install locally

Operon requires **Node.js >= 26** and the pnpm version pinned in
`packageManager`. Node 26 does not bundle Corepack, so install/enable it once
if `pnpm --version` does not match the pin.

```bash
npm install -g corepack   # once per Node installation, when needed
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm link:local
```

`pnpm link:local` exposes `operon` at `~/.local/bin/operon` (or
`$OPERON_BIN_DIR/operon`) and links the `$operon` skill into Codex
(`$CODEX_HOME/skills/operon`), Claude (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/operon`),
and pi (`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills/operon`), using each provider's default
home when its override is unset. Add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH` if necessary. The
local command is source-backed: the next invocation reads the latest source
changes, so no `operon update`, relink, or rebuild is needed. A packed or
published installation uses the packaged `src/operon.cjs` preflight launcher and
then runs the compiled `dist/cli.js` binary. Both launchers report a removed
working directory before ESM resolution with one actionable Operon error.
Rerunning `pnpm link:local` is idempotent and upgrades the former
`scripts/operon-local.mjs` link only when it belongs to that same checkout;
files, directories, and links owned by another checkout remain untouched and
are refused.

These four locations are intentionally different:

| Location | One-line meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Package root | Operon's installed implementation and reusable templates. |
| Org home | Committed roles, apps, pipelines, prompts, authority, taste, and curated memory. |
| State home | Local high-churn clones, worktrees, locks, approvals, telemetry, and run logs. |
| App repo | An independent product checkout that Operon develops or operates. |

Create the org before onboarding an app; this can be run from any directory:

```bash
operon --version
operon org init ~/Build/my-org --name my-org --dry-run
operon org init ~/Build/my-org --name my-org
operon doctor
operon context
```

`org init --dry-run` is a token-free, zero-domain-write preflight: it resolves the org,
state, and pointer paths; lists every generated destination; and shows the
authority summary plus complete packaged role chart. Without `--dry-run`, init
keeps its execute-by-default compatibility. It creates an absent directory or
safely populates an existing real directory while preserving unrelated entries;
an existing org, generated-path collision, or symlink blocks before target
mutation and nothing is overwritten. Once the proposed state home has passed
that validation, the command-level invocation audit is the sole preview write.

Successful init creates a complete org home from packaged templates, including
a versioned `AUTHORITY.md`, creates the
default state home at `~/.operon/<org>`, and records the active org pointer at
`~/.operon/config`. Use `operon org use <path>` to switch to another complete
org. `OPERON_ORG_HOME` and `OPERON_STATE_HOME` are explicit per-process
overrides. The default `delegated-operator` charter automates ordinary,
reversible work while Operon's critical-operation gates remain mandatory;
choose `--authority conservative` or `--authority custom --authority-file
<path> --authority-by <identity>` during onboarding to narrow or replace the
human grant explicitly.

Every dispatched CLI command whose state home is explicit or safely resolved
writes one terminal command row under `invocations/`, including read-only
commands, previews, parser failures, and pre-provider refusals. Rows carry a
stable invocation id, command/subcommand, secret-redacted argv, dry-run flag,
outcome/exit code/duration, and resolved org/app when known. Intent is persisted
first under `state/invocation-journal/`; terminal append is idempotent, and the
next command reconciles a terminal journal or a running journal whose process
is proven dead as `interrupted`. A live process's running journal is never
guessed terminal and remains inspectable. This audit write is the sole
exception to preview/read-only "no state writes" claims. Help, version, the
no-command usage banner, and commands with neither an explicit nor a safely
resolved state home have no org-scoped destination and are deliberately not
journaled.

## Commands

Run `operon --help` or `operon <command> --help` for current syntax. The
read-only discovery surfaces are also machine-readable for coding agents:

```bash
operon capabilities --json
operon context --json
operon roles
operon apps
operon pipelines
operon doctor --json
```

For every command that accepts `--json`, the format contract also covers
failures caught at the CLI boundary. A failed invocation exits non-zero and
prints one document to stdout with `schema_version`, `ok: false`, and a stable
`error.code`, `error.message`, and `error.remediation`; it does not prepend a
plaintext stderr diagnostic. For example, discovery before an org is selected
reports `error.code: "no_active_org"`, so callers never need to match prose.

By default `doctor` runs bounded, non-billable readiness probes only for the
runtimes and models referenced by the active `roles.yaml`: Claude performs an
SDK initialize/account-info control request, Codex performs App Server
`initialize` + `account/read`, and pi resolves its model/auth configuration.
No model prompt is sent. Missing launch artifacts, transport failure, missing
auth, invalid model configuration, and probe timeout are reported distinctly.
Use `operon doctor --config-only` only in an isolated/offline packaging check;
its adapter rows are `WARN` because configuration validity is not runtime
readiness.

Offline onboarding and inspection do not require provider credentials:

```bash

```

Company-lifecycle files placed in
`~/.operon/<org>/state/events/inbox/*.json` use a closed kind registry.
`operon dispatch` reports malformed payloads as `malformed_company_event`,
unregistered kinds as `unknown_company_event_kind`, and valid registered kinds
with no current role trigger as the non-error skip `no_subscriber`; only valid
subscribed kinds spawn turns. See [the event schema contract](docs/scheduler/event-schemas.md)
for the supported kinds, payloads, and exact retention behavior.

Bootstrap accepts a local checkout path, never a GitHub URL. It always joins
the active org and writes app-owned files under `.operon/`, plus one marked,
idempotent authority pointer composed into root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
Existing instruction content is preserved. Its opening output explains the app repo, org home, and
state home before anything is written. A non-interactive run requires
`--answers` or `--answers-from` and otherwise writes no bootstrap artifacts
(the universal command audit row still records the refusal). Normalized
non-secret answers are retained in isolated state and reset archives;
`--answers-from <app>` resolves the app's latest default reset archive.
Generated YAML/authority metadata and text formatting are validated before
success. `new-app` creates a separate product repo and then follows the same
bootstrap/register path. Its backward-compatible default,
`--template typescript-node`, emits the existing npm + strict TypeScript web
scaffold and executable setup/test/lint commands. `--template bare` emits only
stack-neutral product docs and Operon artifacts: no framework, runtime, package
manager, application skeleton, or gate command is inferred from `--goal`.
Required test/lint gates remain explicitly pending and fail closed until the
first implementation configures meaningful stack-specific commands. Dry-run
text and JSON report the selected template, exact paths (including the
generated `.operon/LABELS.md` reference), and gate state. The generated next
steps install the canonical state/tier/priority/domain labels idempotently
before creating the first issue, then preview the supported
`plan --auto --goal ... --source docs/VISION.md --source
docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` form token-free before its live form.
For `bare`, run only the generated stack-and-gates establishment issue through
the loop first; its generated command grants network access for that one
stack-selection/dependency-manifest invocation, and the loop reloads commands
from the Builder worktree before gates. Omit the grant from later invocations
unless their accepted work requires egress.
Verify and preview promotion only after that issue merges with real checks.
Neither command creates or publishes a GitHub repo.

Onboarding claims follow an evidence ladder:

| Evidence | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| Generated | Local app/org artifacts exist; no registry, remote, runtime, or schedule claim follows. |
| Registered | The org registry and app-owned config agree; the app remains onboarding. |
| Runtime-ready | Deterministic verification proves refs, ancestry, canonical GitHub labels (explicitly not applicable for local/file remotes), managed clone, authority/config hashes, app checks, locks/approvals, and required adapters. |
| Live | Human-selected registry policy permits ordinary manual/dispatch work; a scheduler is not implied. |
| Autonomously scheduled | The correct org-scoped scheduler is installed, healthy, and emits attributable due/executed/skipped/blocked evidence. |

These are evidence claims, not five new `apps.yaml` values; registry state
remains `onboarding | live | paused`. `new-app` reaches generated, while a
successful bootstrap reaches registered. Neither alone proves runtime-ready,
live, or autonomous scheduling. The design contract behind all of this —
what bootstrap scans, what verify proves, how promote executes — is
[`docs/org/onboarding.md`](docs/org/onboarding.md).

Scheduler lifecycle is explicitly gated. Preview the exact org-scoped
definition first, then execute only with the reported identity (or exact org
name):

```bash
operon scheduler install --json
operon scheduler install --execute --confirm <scheduler-id>
operon scheduler status --json
operon scheduler uninstall --json
operon scheduler uninstall --execute --confirm <scheduler-id>
```

The generated host definition uses absolute executable, package, org-home, and
state-home paths. It contains no credentials or inherited environment dump.
Status joins ownership/hash/cadence validation, loaded/active manager state,
recent durable ticks, duplicate/orphan checks, and provider settlement
agreement; a definition file alone is never healthy. See
[`docs/scheduler/design.md`](docs/scheduler/design.md) for the canonical schema, identities,
reason codes, and health rules.

The `--dry-run` variants of `new-app`, `plan`, `loop`, `dispatch`, and
`run-role` spend no tokens. The current `plan --auto --dry-run` and
`plan --creator-scope ... --execution-ready --dry-run` and
`plan --explain-route` commands expose only a provisional, token-free intent
preview: current ledger budget, declared request facts, assignment candidates,
safety facts, creator-scope assessment, and the fixed planner boot boundary.
Repository/source inspection owned by the live snapshot remains clearly
deferred. The previews deliberately return
`exactProviderAuthoredPlan: null`; ordinary auto planning needs a live
EpisodePlanner call, while explicit creator scope is normalized and persisted
only during live execution. `operon episode explain <episode-id>` exposes the
read-only durable plan, assignment rationale, route, and execution status. It
degrades instead of failing: it prints the directory it read, renders whatever
durable evidence exists, annotates anything it could not resolve, and exits
non-zero when the explanation is incomplete. `--json` emits the same
explanation as one document.

Fresh standalone `run-role` preview and live invocations require the same app,
invocation identity, bounded template, and assignment semantics. `--turn` is a
trace/session identity, not a GitHub ticket number or ticket binding. The
preview reads and hashes the template, validates the execution-ready creator
scope, reports its provenance/objective/atomic assignment, constructs no
provider runtime, and writes no workflow state beyond its command audit row. Provider readiness, live budget and
approval outcomes, managed-clone synchronization, and later external-state
changes remain explicit exclusions. `--workdir` is intentionally unsupported:
preview reads a discovered registered checkout, while live execution
synchronizes the org-managed clone. A durable resume may reuse its persisted
creator bytes without a mutable template file; scheduled/event routes keep
their governed pipeline scope.

`run-role` denies network access by default. `--allow-network` admits egress
for that invocation only, appears in the token-free brief, and is bound into
the durable creator scope so a resumed turn cannot silently change it.

Live forms can spend tokens and touch GitHub:

```bash
operon plan <app> --auto --goal "<bounded goal>"
operon plan <app> --creator-scope ./scope.yaml --execution-ready --no-publish
operon loop --app <app> --once
operon dispatch
```

An execution-ready creator scope is the explicit alternative to the dedicated
EpisodePlanner design turn. `--creator-scope` and `--execution-ready` are
required together; readiness is never inferred from a detailed-looking goal or
file. JSON and YAML are transport formats for the existing strict
`CreatorEpisodeScope` schema, not separate plan schemas. The scope's objective
supplies `--goal` when it is omitted. A mismatched disposition, incomplete
scope, unknown operation/role, or unapproved adaptive assignment fails before
provider construction instead of silently falling back to EpisodePlanner.

```yaml
planningDisposition: execution_ready
provenance:
  source: human
  creatorId: operator@example.com
  createdAt: "2026-07-20T12:00:00.000Z"
  evidenceRefs: [docs/specs/feature-a.md]
workKind: bounded-product-plan
objective: Turn the approved Feature A design into implementation tickets
inScope: [Preserve and decompose the approved Feature A design]
outOfScope: [Redesign Feature A]
acceptanceCriteria: [Every approved criterion appears in a buildable ticket]
expectedArtifacts:
  - {id: ticket-plan, kind: TicketPlan, required: true}
declaredConstraints: {designRef: docs/specs/feature-a.md}
safetyFacts: []
steps:
  - kind: provider_turn
    id: ticket-plan
    operation: plan/decompose
    role: planner
    objective: Render the approved design as a TicketPlan
    dependsOn: []
    requiredCapabilities: [structured_verdict]
    inputRefs: []
    expectedOutputs:
      - {id: ticket-plan, kind: TicketPlan, required: true}
    maxTurnBudgetUsd: 5
    selectionReason: The creator already supplied every design decision
```

The terminal operation must match the requested/default stage:
`plan/bootstrap` for bootstrap and `plan/decompose` for growth or mature.
In fixed assignment mode, omit `assignment` and Operon resolves the configured
role tuple. In adaptive mode, each provider step must include one exact approved
`assignment` tuple. `--dry-run` validates and previews creator-scope
normalization with zero runtime calls or durable writes. Live execution skips
the dedicated EpisodePlanner, persists the creator provenance and normalized
EpisodePlan, executes only the declared governed planning steps, and sends the
resulting schema-validated TicketPlan through the same no-publish or
orchestrator-owned publication projection as ordinary planning.

## Reset an app for another test iteration

Use `operon app reset <app>` to begin another onboarding/build-loop iteration
without deleting the GitHub repository or the organization. It is a
non-mutating plan by default: it inventories the selected app's managed local
state and identifiable Operon GitHub work (`op:*` issues and PRs linked to
them), and reports blockers such as active turns, locks, journals, or pending
approvals.

```bash
operon app reset buildstacks.dev
operon app reset buildstacks.dev --execute --confirm buildstacks.dev --force
```

Execution first writes a checksummed archive to
`~/.operon/archives/<org>/<app>-reset-<fingerprint>/` (or `--archive-root`), then
closes the planned PRs/issues, deletes their head branches, removes the app
from `apps.yaml`, and clears its managed clone, worktrees, runs, ticket state,
approval records, schedules, and ledger rows. It never deletes the GitHub
repository, its default branch, a human checkout, or the GitHub history of
closed work. Re-onboard the checkout with `operon bootstrap <local-repo>
--answers-from <archive-or-app>` when ready. Reset JSON includes typed blocker
codes, ids, force eligibility, and remediation. Its durable intent and
checksummed archive make a killed execution safely resumable without losing
the originally reviewed GitHub plan.

`--force` is intentionally narrow: it permits cleanup past a `running` record
whose heartbeat is more than ten minutes old. It never overrides a fresh run,
active journal/lock, or pending approval.

Legacy org migration and the registered-to-live lifecycle are also plan-first
and token-free:

```bash
operon org upgrade --authority delegated-operator --json
operon org upgrade --authority delegated-operator --execute --json
operon app verify <app> --json
operon app promote <app> --to live --json
operon app promote <app> --to live --execute --json
```

Upgrade is additive, archive-backed, and followed by org/authority validation.
Verification proves remote/default ancestry, managed HEAD, registry/config and
authority hashes, app checks, approvals/locks, and static adapter/model
readiness without starting a runtime. Gate commands in `.operon/config.yaml`
are top-level keys (siblings of `apps`, never under `apps.<name>`). A real
verify accepts a valid changed config only from the fetched remote default
branch, records its exact hash and commit in a crash-resumable lifecycle
journal, and gives promotion preview an actionable `app verify` remediation
without mutating the record. Promotion mutates app/registry status
only after verification and resumes exactly once across config, commit, push,
and registry boundaries. All lifecycle JSON is canonically key-sorted.

Contributors can still use `pnpm dev <command>` inside the Operon source repo,
but product and org workflows should exercise the installed `operon` command
from a neutral directory.

## Live UI and Reports

`operon observe` starts one read-only local server in the foreground. **Live**
remains at `/`; **Reports** is available at `/reports` under the same
per-process capability, listener, security headers, and navigation shell. It resolves
the active org and state home independently of the working directory, binds
only to `127.0.0.1`, and prints a per-process capability URL. Use `--app`,
`--parent-task`, or `--ticket` to deep-link a scoped view; `--open` launches the
local browser. `--parent-task` opens that historical session initially while
keeping sibling sessions available in the chooser. The observer performs no
provider turn and spends no tokens.

The page separates app onboarding and non-ticket intake, GitHub delivery work,
and approvals. A top-right Session chooser switches between **Live org** and
historical parent tasks (plus standalone traces for older uncorrelated work),
using the identical dashboard and evidence drawer; the selection survives URL
refreshes while SSE continues. Open GitHub issues labeled `op:ready` are the
only claimable product-delivery queue. HTTP supplies a versioned snapshot and
deliberate allowlisted evidence; SSE supplies cursor-based live updates. Exact
prompts, briefs, outputs, and `session.log` are never preloaded or streamed;
they require an explicit local fetch, and `session.log` is labeled **activity
log—not transcript**. There are no configuration, approval, retry, merge,
label, deploy, or other mutation routes or controls. Closing the browser or
observer cannot stop a run.

Reports are explicit as-of snapshots, not SSE-updating live totals. The first
panel discloses incomplete, estimated, unavailable, duplicate, corrupt,
unsettled, legacy, or retention-limited data before showing known tokens,
equivalent-cost provenance, trends, allocations, operating-health
distributions, current-month budget context, and exhaustive session/pass
detail. An observer started with `--app` is server-scoped: its Reports mode
cannot query the org or sibling apps.

`operon report` provides the same ledger-first read model without starting a
server. Omitted `--app` means the active org; the default is the trailing 90
UTC calendar days. Terminal output is concise, while `--json` and portable
`--html` are exhaustive unless `--summary-only` is explicit. Portable HTML is
one responsive, accessible, print-friendly file with a hash-restricted CSP,
no external requests, and no prompts, briefs, outputs, or activity logs.
Report generation never reconciles or mutates state. `operon telemetry`
remains the envelope-first forensic trace/evidence report, and `operon budget`
remains the current-calendar-month enforcement rollup; selected multi-month
report spend is never compared directly with one monthly cap.

## Setup / auth

The offline commands above need nothing. The live commands need:

- **Claude auth** for `plan`, `loop`, and `dispatch`. Auth is
  subscription-first (any usable Claude Agent SDK auth counts); `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  is a fallback. (`gpt-5.6-sol` in Codex uses the installed
  ChatGPT-account-authenticated App Server path.)
- **No self-approval variable is required by default.** Live loop/dispatch
  execution race-safely creates an owner-only HMAC key at
  `<stateHome>/state/self-approval-secret`; it is resolved by the orchestrator
  and never placed in provider context or environment. Set
  `OPERON_SELF_APPROVAL_SECRET` only as an explicit compatibility override.
  A corrupt, linked, or weakly-permissioned state key fails closed.

Environment variables are loaded per project from `.env` / `.env.local` at the
git root; there is no `.env.example` yet — the variables above are the full set.

## Testing

**Validation rebuild in progress (decided 2026-07-31).** The legacy offline
suite and the qualification/release-gate machinery this section used to
describe are frozen under `archive-do-not-read/` — never read, cite, or run
anything there (`archive-do-not-read/README.md`). The replacement harness is
being designed by the Validation-Design-Agent under the five-layer model and
lands in `claude-tests/`. Release gating is **suspended** until it rebuilds an
equivalent.

The interim verification for source changes is:

```bash
pnpm test          # vitest over claude-tests/ — green-by-absence until the first spec lands
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm smoke:onboarding   # packaging / onboarding changes
npm pack --dry-run      # packaging changes
```

The ratified Phase 6 boundary is defined only in
[`docs/qualification/design.md`](docs/qualification/design.md#phase-6-qualification-scope);
that document remains the canonical *contract*, but its executable machinery
(campaign scripts, evidence promotion, release attestation) is archived and
non-operational during the rebuild. The retained Phase 6 candidate-campaign
records stay in `research/evals/`. The independent control-plane boundary and
incremental workflow are canonical in the repository-only
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md); those developer instructions and
grants never become authority for an operated org.

## Observability: where agent activity is recorded

The operational evidence stores live under the org's *state home*
(`~/.operon/<org>/` by default), with one authority per fact:

The experiment and activation substrate (M3–M5) lives in the *committed org
home* instead — `learning/experiments/` (ExperimentRecords + EvalResults,
declared before results), `learning/interventions/` (one lineage record per
published change), `learning/evals/**` (sanitized eval fixtures converted
from replay capsules, trusted only after independent validation),
`learning/candidates/` (agent-emitted, no authority, never resolvable),
`learning/reviews/` + `learning/rejections.jsonl` (fail-closed reviewer
verdicts and the suppression ledger), `learning/quarantine/` (human-authored
provisionals with resolver-enforced TTLs), `learning/bundle/**` +
`learning/manifest.yaml` (active concepts, version cuts, and live-canary
trial state), and `learning/proposals/**` (unmerged drafts) — everything
except candidates and proposals is gate-protected; only humans and the
deterministic publisher write inside.

`runs/` is the per-pass source of truth (what was asked, what happened, what
it cost). The ledger is the rollup `operon budget`, `operon status`, retro,
and scorecards read: every provider turn settles into it exactly once, keyed
on `(app, providerTurnId)` for current rows and `(app, runId)` for legacy rows
— completed, blocked, and failed provider invocations alike — so budget caps
are enforced against real spend, and a tick whose app has exhausted its
monthly cap refuses to claim before any pass starts. `operon budget
--reconcile` repairs stale terminal execution receipts and back-fills missing
settlements idempotently.
Subscription-backed provider costs are Operon-computed equivalent-cost
estimates, flagged as such on every row. `operon telemetry --app <app>
[--html out.html]` renders the run view and copies linked artifacts into an
adjacent evidence bundle.

None of these stores grows forever: every state subtree has a documented
retention window, swept fail-safe once per UTC day from the dispatch tick
(docs/scheduler/design.md → State retention; manual form `operon prune-runs
--sweep`). Ledger day-files are never deleted while `budget --reconcile`
could still re-settle their rows from surviving evidence, and the committed
org-home `learning/**` substrate plus the state home's durable learning
archives are never swept.

`operon report [--app <app>] [--period 90d] [--json|--html out.html]`
instead reads the ledger first, keeps duplicate rows as recorded, separates
provider-reported, estimated, partial, and unknown cost, and groups explicit
parent tasks, traces, orphan runs, mechanical passes, and legacy unattributed
turns for management drill-down without copying L3 evidence. Current-month
budget context uses the same ledger semantics as `operon budget`; historical
range spend remains a separate fact. CLI, JSON, portable HTML, and Observe
`/reports` also project route history, terminal/settlement integrity,
productive and repeated-work evidence, elapsed/active/human-wait time, and
rendered context bytes by source; missing legacy evidence stays named and
invalidates the affected metric instead of becoming zero.

For work delegated from an outer Codex/Claude session, begin a parent record
once with `operon task begin --id <id> --prompt-file <exact-prompt>`, export
the printed `OPERON_PARENT_TASK_ID`, and then run Planner/Builder/Reviewer
commands normally. Use `operon task fallback` before any external/manual
continuation and `operon task finish` only at the actual outcome boundary.
Telemetry joins those child traces back to the exact prompt and will not call
a task “Operon end-to-end complete” when a required stage or Reviewer is
missing, or when execution used a fallback.

Episode execution now has one workflow authority: a schema-validated,
versioned `EpisodePlan`. EpisodePlanner normally designs the smallest
sufficient role/step DAG before delivery. A creator may avoid that provider
turn only by deliberately supplying complete scope, acceptance criteria,
artifacts, governed steps or a workflow-template reference, safety facts, and
provenance; Operon normalizes it into the same plan and validates it under the
same policy. Incomplete creator scope remains authoritative input, but
EpisodePlanner fills the missing decisions.

App configuration uses `execution.assignment_mode: fixed | adaptive` and
defaults omission to `fixed`. Fixed mode preserves the role's configured
harness/model/effort tuple. Adaptive mode can only select exact, qualified
role candidates allowed by the org and optionally narrowed by the app. The
tuple is persisted and resumed atomically; no fallback may change just its
harness, model, or effort. Roles still own instructions, tools, permissions,
and expected outputs, so a different assignment never grants broader
authority. See `docs/architecture.md` § 7 for the exact
`adaptive_assignments` and app-narrowing schema.

After validation, the plan is written before its first delivery turn. Its
typed provider, mechanical-gate, and approval steps execute in deterministic
dependency order. New material evidence can produce a bounded, forward-only
plan revision: completed steps, artifacts, approvals, and accounting remain
linked to the version that authorized them. Budget, approval requirements,
and quick/standard/deep labels are projections of the accepted plan constrained
by hard policy, not inputs that choose a generic pass set. `pipelines.yaml`
remains a governed protocol vocabulary and one-step provider transport for the
current executor; it is not a second workflow planner.

`operon plan --auto` is itself an EpisodePlanner-backed episode. Its accepted
plan selects the smallest DAG over code-owned, human-ratified product-planning
operations; the terminal operation emits the existing schema-validated
`TicketPlan`, which the deterministic publisher may turn into GitHub issues.
The old depth/risk flags remain bounded request facts and compatibility input,
not pass selectors or planner-bypass signals. Use `operon episode explain
<episode-id>` for the accepted execution plan's durable explanation.

Automated planning also accepts repeatable required `--source <file-or-dir>`
and optional `--optional-source <file-or-dir>` inputs. Relative paths resolve
against the exact source checkout; absolute external sources are allowed.
Operon resolves bounded directories, content-hashes UTF-8 text, applies the
shared secret boundary, and records canonical refs, bytes, trust, selection,
truncation/exclusion, and consumption before constructing a provider runtime.
A missing, unreadable, rejected, or over-budget required source fails closed.
Every pass retains `planning-sources.json`; emitted tickets carry only the
manifest/source refs and hashes, never the source bytes.

`operon learn` is the learning loop's human window; `operon learn --help`
has the full argument semantics. The capture verbs (`report`, `inspect
<episode-id>`, `show <id>`, `emit`, `fixture`) read and annotate episodes
and convert closed episodes into eval fixtures (trusted only after an
independent `--validate --by <someone-else>`). The M4 activation verbs
(`review`, `publish`, `resolve`, `disable`, `rollback`, `provisional`)
drive manual governed activation: review fails closed, activation into
context or T2/T3 raises a content-bound approval, and nothing
self-activates. The M5 evaluation verbs (`experiment declare|run|list`,
`canary start|status|promote|stop`) run the design-§9.5 offline funnel —
paired control/treatment replays in seed worktrees, early stopping, spend
settled into the org ledger and capped by the learning budget `operon
budget` renders — and the human-started, episode-sticky live canary (a T3
live canary is unrepresentable in policy; insufficient volume reads
`inconclusive` — human judgment, never limbo).

## Status

Operon is build-complete and proven live: real Planner/Builder/Reviewer turns
take GitHub issues from `op:ready` through quality gates, PR, cross-provider
review, and squash-merge on real repos — most recently `operon-sandbox-delta`
("Ledgerette"), onboarded from scratch, where the loop fixed and merged both
planted bugs unaided. A 2026-07-10 proportionality campaign then
rebuilt the org's economics end to end: per-pass ledger settlement with
enforced budget caps, durable continuation from artifacts, honest stops with
token-free environment preflight, one-pass proportional bootstrap planning
published by the orchestrator, a ratified approval & release boundary (scoped
grants, release handoff, adapter-level role toolset shaping), and a
repeatable clean-room benchmark
([`docs/qualification/benchmark-runbook.md`](docs/qualification/benchmark-runbook.md)). On top of that
substrate, a governed learning loop
([`docs/learning-loop/`](docs/learning-loop/), ratified 2026-07-11) is complete
and live through M6: every pass is captured into episodes and replay
capsules, and learned changes activate only through human review, offline
paired-replay evaluation, a human-started canary, and M6 scheduled
distillation with independent review and report-only compaction. The latest dated live evidence is
[`research/2026-07-11_adapter-tool-events.md`](research/2026-07-11_adapter-tool-events.md);
open work lives in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/buildstacks-dev/Operon/issues).

`docs/harness/capability-matrix.md` records each adapter's native, adapter-built, and
degraded capabilities. (The gated live-adapter proof suite is archived during
the validation rebuild — see Testing above.)

### Known limitations

- **Live UI V1 is local-only.** It has no remote/public bind, TLS, multi-user
  auth, cloud ingestion, or workflow controls. Use SSH port forwarding to the
  loopback capability URL when observing a remote host. GitHub is polled on a
  bounded interval and may show an explicitly degraded last-known projection
  while local run evidence remains live.

- **Tool-event outcomes are partial on Claude and pi.** All three adapters
  emit `tool_use` turn events (issue #27, live-verified 2026-07-11 —
  `research/2026-07-11_adapter-tool-events.md`), so `envelope.tool_counts`
  is populated and all five anomaly detectors can fire. But Claude and pi
  surface tool calls before execution, so their events carry no
  `success`/`durationMs` outcome fields; per-tool failure and latency
  analytics are Codex-only for now.
- **Native interactive co-planning is retired.** A TTY child process cannot
  preserve the durable EpisodePlan, exact assignment, gate, run-envelope, and
  settlement boundary, so bare `operon plan <app>` fails closed. Use
  `plan --auto --goal ...` for EpisodePlanner-backed planning, or
  `plan --creator-scope <json-or-yaml> --execution-ready` for an explicitly
  complete creator-authored bypass. The manual `--dry-run` form remains as a
  token-free current-worktree/context preview.
- **Bootstrap publication is draft-PR-only.** `operon bootstrap publish <app>`
  previews by default; `--execute` stages only bootstrap-owned paths, cuts
  `op/bootstrap-<app>` from each remote's resolved default branch, and opens
  draft pull requests — it never merges or marks ready, is idempotent on
  retry, and refuses when unrelated staged changes, a merge in progress, or a
  detached HEAD make the scope ambiguous. Marking ready and merging stay
  human ([issue #61](https://github.com/buildstacks-dev/Operon/issues/61),
  closed 2026-07-18).
- **Codex App-Server read bypass:** under the `untrusted` approval policy the
  App Server auto-runs trusted read-only commands (`cat`, `ls`) without an
  approval request, so those reads do not reach the gate hook. Tracked in
  [issue #20](https://github.com/buildstacks-dev/Operon/issues/20) with live
  evidence and the required upstream capability.
