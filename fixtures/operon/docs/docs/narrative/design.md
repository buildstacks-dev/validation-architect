# Narrative V1 — human-level causal observability (`operon narrative`)

Status: implemented (#129, workstream:narrative). This file is the surface's
authoritative contract, following the observe/report/scheduler precedent.

## 1. Purpose and non-goals

Telemetry answers "what did it cost", Observe answers "what is happening",
Reports answer "what happened, statistically". Narrative answers the question
a human actually asks: **"why does the product look like this?"** — this
prompt came in → produced this plan → which created these tickets → which the
builder built → which were reviewed and merged.

Non-goals, inherited deliberately:
- **No model-authored prose** (docs/reporting/design.md decision): the story
  is templated deterministically over durable records. Zero tokens, zero
  chance of a history that is subtly wrong about itself.
- **No workflow state**: a presentation-only leaf. Deleting `narrative/`
  loses captured quotes whose sources have since been retention-swept, but
  never affects a run.
- **No network**: renders from disk alone. (The permanent `Planned-by:`
  ticket trailer enables GitHub-side re-derivation later; V1 does not fetch.)

## 2. Story unit: the episode, not the day

One markdown file per episode; a time-ordered `INDEX.md` per app links into
them. A ticket spanning three days stays one unbroken arc; "show me July" is
an index slice. Date-bucketing is the right axis for logs, which is exactly
why it is the wrong axis for narrative.

## 3. Storage and retention

State home:
```
narrative/<app>/
  INDEX.md               time-ordered episode index (regenerated each render)
  <episode-slug>.json    story capture — the durable projection incl. quotes
  <episode-slug>.md      rendered story (derived from capture each render)
```
- `<episode-slug>` = episode id with path-unsafe chars collapsed, suffixed
  with an 8-hex sha256 of the exact id (`storySlug` delegates to the runlog
  `hashedFileStem`, importable by org-layer retention without touching this
  leaf) so unvalidated app names and `:`-bearing episode ids can never
  collide or escape the directory.
- The `.json` capture is the source of truth for the `.md`; markdown format
  can evolve without losing captured quotes. A corrupt capture is
  quarantined to `<slug>.json.corrupt` (bytes preserved for forensics) and
  recaptured from live sources — never silently overwritten, never allowed
  to hide the story from the INDEX.
- Retention: `narrativeDays: 1825` in `DEFAULT_STATE_RETENTION` — the
  longest window in the table; this is the institutional record the other
  subtrees feed. The sweeper ages a story pair by the capture's own
  `captured_at` **with identity binding** (only a record whose story_id/app
  map to its own filename is deletable — foreign/torn files are kept, fail
  safe), deletes `.md` before `.json` so a crash can never orphan an
  unageable `.md`, ages orphaned `.md` and quarantined `.corrupt` files by
  fs mtime, and never touches INDEX.md (src/org/retention.ts
  `sweepNarrative`).

## 4. Quote-at-write-time

`runs/` (all verbatim L1+L3) is swept at 30 days; the join IDs live 180–365.
A pure-hyperlink narrative reads beautifully for a month and then becomes
dead links. So the projector **inlines bounded, redacted excerpts at capture
time** and links to full forensics as a bonus that degrades gracefully:

- originating prompt (parent task `prompt.md`, or the planning brief goal)
- the plan thesis + published ticket list (`published-tickets.json`, #128)
- per pass: role, model, verdict summary, short output excerpt
- gate results, review findings, approval decisions
- merge/release outcome (ExecutionJournal stages + ticket transitions)

Rules:
- Every quoted byte passes through `scrubSecrets` (the ONE secret-regex
  list) **at capture time, with the CURRENT pattern list** — including
  envelope `verdict_summary`, ticket titles, and journal stop reasons that
  were already scrubbed at write time with whatever list existed then.
  Captures outlive their sources by years; the newest list wins.
- Excerpts are bounded (per-quote and per-story byte caps).
- **Merge, never lose, never regress**: re-render re-projects from live
  sources and merges. Captured quotes and moments survive source expiry; a
  fold computed from partially swept sources (missing runs the capture knew
  about) can never flip a terminal status, and story-level fields are
  monotonic — `opened` never moves later, enriched titles are never
  replaced by their generic prefix, cost never shrinks, planned tickets
  union rather than replace. An episode whose sources are fully swept
  renders unchanged from its capture.
- **Identity binds to the directory**: an envelope whose `run_id`/`app` do
  not match the run dir it sits in is skipped loudly — a copied or tampered
  run dir can never smuggle foreign content into another app's narrative or
  reach a path join.

## 5. Sources (all existing, all read-only)

| Hop | Source |
| --- | --- |
| originating prompt | `tasks/<taskId>/prompt.md` (180d) |
| support/company event → turn | `TurnJournal.event` |
| event → planner feed → planner turn | `standing-roles/<app>/planner-feeds/` receipts |
| planner run → tickets | `published-tickets.json` (#128) + `Planned-by:` trailer |
| ticket → episode | deterministic episode id |
| episode → turns/runs/passes | `learning/episodes/<id>.json` (unswept) |
| ticket build→review→merge | `efficiency/episodes/<hash>/execution-journal.json` (180d) |
| verbatim text | `runs/<app>/<runId>/{brief,prompt,output}.md` (30d) |
| cost | telemetry ledger rows (365d) |

Every reader tolerates absence (returns "expired/unknown", never throws the
render away) and surfaces corruption without masking it.

## 6. Module shape

`src/narrative/` (presentation leaf; imports org/loop/runtime, nothing
imports it except its CLI):
- `types.ts` — the v1 capture schema (`NarrativeStory`, moments, quotes)
- `sources.ts` — tolerant readers over the table above; every quoted byte
  passes `scrubSecrets`, corruption is collected into `problems[]`, never
  thrown away with the render
- `story.ts` — the pure fold: envelopes grouped by episode → stories;
  planning↔ticket join through #128 publication records, delivery from the
  execution journal, cost from settled ledger rows only
- `capture.ts` — merge-write `<slug>.json` (writeLoopFileAtomic): fresh
  structure wins, captured quotes/moments are never lost, corrupt captures
  are surfaced and never overwritten
- `render.ts` — deterministic markdown for stories and the INDEX; no
  wall-clock ("as of" derives from the capture's newest source timestamp)
- `src/cli/narrative.ts` — `operon narrative [--app <app>] [--episode <id>]
  [--json]`; one registry line in cli.ts. Default renders all apps found in
  apps.yaml ∪ runs/ ∪ narrative/; `--episode` prints one story without
  writing.

## 7. Scope V1 and follow-ups

V1: build episodes end-to-end (ticket → PR → merge) plus planning traces,
joined through #128. Standing-role episodes (SRE/Support/Marketing drafts
that never become tickets) and GitHub-side re-derivation are follow-ups.

## 8. Tests

Fixtures via `test/fixtures/orgHome.ts` + `fakeClock.ts`:
- byte-stable output on unchanged sources (determinism)
- quote preservation after deleting `runs/` (retention survival)
- seeded secret never reaches capture or render (redaction)
- corrupt/torn/missing source tolerance
- in-progress episode → completed transition (merge semantics)
- INDEX ordering and slug collision behavior
