/**
 * Normative traceability conventions for the AGENTS.md contribution
 * (issue #4). The designer must include this block in
 * `agents-md-contribution.md` so every coding agent — Cursor, Codex, Claude
 * Code — lands specs the `validation-trace` CLI can close against.
 *
 * These are building codes, not taste. The product repo's CI runs the
 * trace CLI against them; a silent rename or an unowned family turns the
 * gate red.

export const TRACEABILITY_CONVENTIONS = `**Traceability conventions** (normative — the \`validation-trace\` CLI enforces their mechanical closure subset in CI):

1. **Test directories are named by case-family ID.** Specs for \`CF-INV-001\` live under a directory whose name contains \`cf-inv-001\` (case-insensitive); likewise for every other family. Helpers and fixtures that are not family-scoped may sit beside them.
2. **Spec file headers cite the family and the owning backlog ticket.** The first comment block of every \`*.test.*\` / \`*.spec.*\` file names the \`CF-…\` family it exercises and the \`HB-…\` ticket that owns it (plus the contract/invariant section it binds to). A citation the catalog does not know is an orphan — the trace CLI turns red.
3. **Every implementable family owns ≥1 citing spec, or is declared pending with its wave.** Non-pruned, non-blocked families without a citing spec must appear on a backlog ticket whose status is not LANDED. A LANDED ticket whose families lack specs is a status-honesty failure.
4. **Traceability updates in the same change as the tests.** Adding, moving, or deleting a citing spec updates \`case-catalog.yaml\` (and the markdown catalog it must agree with) and the backlog's status annotations in the same change — never a follow-up.
5. **The machine-readable catalog is authoritative for tools.** \`case-catalog.yaml\` is the companion of \`case-catalog.md\`; disagreement between them is a corpus bug. The markdown catalog remains the human artifact.
6. **Implement tickets via the \`implement-harness-ticket\` skill.** That skill is the standard path from an HB ticket to landed specs: ticket → family → ratified enumeration → red-then-green tests, with the conventions above so \`validation-trace\` stays green. Do not invent a parallel workflow.
7. **Regenerate \`owner-backlog.md\` when the backlog changes.** The companion is non-normative and living; a backlog edit that leaves the companion's ticket-ID set stale is a corpus bug.
8. **Resolve outcome-acceptance families from \`acceptance/\`.** An \`L-ACC\` family binds realistic scenario briefs and human-ratified rubric axes. Mechanical campaign guardrails (sealed answers, producer↔grader independence, preflight, spend cutoff, intermediate-gate persistence) remain layer-1/2 detectors with negative controls; do not recast a scored axis as binary merely to make it easy to implement.
9. **Outcome campaigns require fresh human authorization.** Implementing their fixtures and mechanical preflights is ordinary ticket work; running a live layer-6 campaign is not. It names its target, scenario set, spend/time ceiling, and permitted effects, and incomplete inputs or missing grader calibration produce \`inconclusive\`, never green.
10. **Non-test-lane families declare their evidence in the catalog row.** A family whose oracle lives outside the test tree — an L3 certification record, an L4 human-validated golden corpus, an L5 triggered-obligation record, an L-ACC campaign report — carries \`EVIDENCE:<state>:<path>\` in its catalog cell (state ∈ \`complete\` | \`incomplete\` | \`inconclusive\` | \`unobserved\`; path repo-relative). \`validation-trace\` verifies the artifact exists and surfaces the state: a missing artifact is RED, and any state other than \`complete\` is visible declared partiality, never green-by-assertion. Ordinary test-lane families never substitute evidence for a citing spec.`;
