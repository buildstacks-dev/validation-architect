# Case catalog — Operon (product scope, matrix closure)

Status: derived to matrix closure (Phase 6, agent-alone per Division of labor §6) over
the ratified artifacts: system-map (J-01…J-18), invariants (INV-001…015), boundary-map
(B-01…B-17), contracts (22 canonical IDs), llm-eval-plan (S-1…S-7 and S-9; S-8 intentionally absent), risk-allocation
(E-1/E-2/E-3, floors, §5/§6 obligations). **This is design derivation, not
implementation** — executable authoring waits for the walking skeleton's fixtures
(harness-backlog.md); derivation does not.

**Closure rule:** every (source artifact × derivation row) cell below carries case
families or a **named prune**. Prune vocabulary (nothing else is legal):
- `PRUNE-thin` — deliberately thin per risk-allocation §4 (smoke only or none).
- `PRUNE-dup:<cell>` — covered by the named cell (single-writer rule; no clone).
- `PRUNE-na` — dimension structurally inapplicable to this source (reason inline).
- `BLOCKED:<finding>` — cases exist but are parked until the finding ratifies
  (now F-PT-006/008 only; F-PT-003/004/007 were ratified 2026-07-31 and their former
  blocked cells below are derivable against the ratified contracts); listed, never
  authored as truth.
- `BLOCKED:B-17-L3` — live-target cases parked per boundary-map B-17 status.

**Row/oracle/layer keys.** Layer 1/2/3/4/5 per taxonomy; oracle kinds: `state` (durable
state assertion), `evid` (evidence/record assertion), `refusal` (typed refusal/exit
code), `diff` (byte/scope diff), `det` (detector fired), `stat` (statistical, §9
decision-status rule applies), `live` (live-run binary). Risk: E1/E2/E3 (exhaustive
families), STD, THIN, FLOOR (non-discretionary). **L4Q** is a formally
defined additional risk category: the statistical quality lane — funding priority per
risk-allocation §4, governed by the eval-plan §9 decision-status rule (no verdict may be
green until the owning finding ratifies). Adversity (crash/kill/sleep/partition)
is applied via the B-06/B-07/B-15 modifier rows inside each family — never a row here
(stimulus taxonomy).

Family IDs are stable: `CF-<source>-<row>`. Traces resolve per the
journey-acceptance.md alias table.

## 3. Invariant matrix (INV × violation-paths / guardrail-response)

Seed adversarial cases are ratified in invariants.md; each row's family = those seeds
plus the guardrail's negative control (skill rule 16 — the detector proves it can fire).

| Cell | Family (violation paths → guardrail response) | Layer | Oracle | Risk |

## 4. Boundary matrix (B × success / timeout / partial-success / retry / duplicate / stale-read / version-skew)

<!-- changelog 2026-07-31 (reader test, new-engineer finding 4): collapsing
convention stated here, matching §5's. -->
**Row-collapsing convention (same as §5):** one family row per boundary stands for
its seven nominal failure-mode columns — the family text enumerates the modes;
separately-risky dimensions (the `-L3` live obligations) get their own rows. The §9
closure statement reconciles the 126 semantic cells against these families.
Failure-mode lists are ratified per boundary in boundary-map.md; each cell's family =
those modes under the honest fake, plus the fake/real conformance pair where an L3
obligation exists.

| Cell | Family | Layer | Oracle | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Worktree-content preservation asserted up to the accepted-artifact line; **ambiguous-byte disposition per ratified F-PT-004 (2026-07-31): preserve-and-inspect, never reset** (cases derivable — HB-P2) | 2 | state+refusal | E2 |

## 5. Contract matrix (C × valid/invalid inputs / outputs / typed errors / idempotency / ordering / freshness+latency)

Each contract file's five parts generate the row set mechanically; the family asserts
every clause of the ratified contract text. Cells collapsed per contract (one family
spanning the six rows) except where a dimension is separately risky.

| Cell | Family | Layer | Oracle | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CF-C-CORE | OPERON-C-CORE-001 all clauses: TurnRequest validity/refusals, envelope guarantees, usage-as-provided-or-unknown, typed errors, never-auto-retry, budget observation at capability-matrix points, settlement | 1/2 | state+refusal | E2 (T-11) |
Eighteen boundary-contract families (B-09a and B-09b are separate contracts), one per
canonical `OPERON-C-B*-001` ID, each clause-complete (valid/invalid inputs, outputs,
typed errors, idempotency, ordering, freshness/latency), incl. every PROPOSED-register
value asserted as provisional. **Per-ID resolver:**

## 6. Interface-adapter matrix (adapter × conformance / error-translation / cross-surface agreement)

## 8. Operational-obligation matrix (obligation × load-at-contention / soak / resource-growth / clock-skew / abuse / recovery)

| Cell | Family | Layer | Oracle | Risk |

## 9. Closure statement

- **Journeys:** 18 × 5 = **90 semantic cells, written as 86 table rows** (the single
  J-13 row covers its five dup-pruned cells). Accounting: **81 family cells + 9
  pruned/blocked cells** — J-06-A (na), J-10-A (na), J-13 ×5 (dup), J-16-RC (dup),
  J-17-A (BLOCKED:B-17-L3). CF-J10-I is a family cell carrying an embedded named
  block (F-PT-006). <!-- ratification 2026-07-31: J-07-I unblocked (F-PT-003
  ratified) — moved from the blocked count to the family count; CF-J04-I's embedded
  F-PT-004 block resolved (ratified line encoded in-cell). -->
- **State machines:** 8 machines × 4 rows = 32 cells → all traced (2 dup prunes; 1
  F-PT-006 block).
- **Invariants:** 15 × 2 rows → 15 families (violation+guardrail folded; every family
  carries its negative control).
- **Boundaries:** 17 numbered boundaries become **18 matrix entries** (B-09 splits into
  B-09a and B-09b) × 7 rows = **126 semantic cells** → traced via the §4 families
  (B-08, B-11 dup-pruned to their journey/state owners; finding-blocks named in-cell).
- **Contracts:** 22 canonical IDs = 18 boundary contracts (incl. B-09A/B-09B
  separately) + CORE + 3 OP → 22 clause-complete families; acceptance criteria
  dup-pruned to their §1 cells.
- **Interfaces:** 6 families incl. the single cross-surface agreement check.
- **LLM sites:** **8 site families (S-1…S-7, S-9) × 4 rows = 32 cells** → every cell
  now explicitly a family, PRUNE-na, PRUNE-dup, or finding-parked; no quality cell may
  yield pass/fail until its owning finding ratifies (L4Q category).
- **Ops obligations:** 7 rows → **5 families (CONT, SOAK, ROT, GROW, ABUSE-interim) +
  2 dup prunes**. Layer 5 holds CONT (hermetic rig, L5 by question), SOAK, ROT (named
  Codex-rotation sub-obligation with its own completion evidence), and the
  deferred-declared ABUSE lane behind the ratified threat model; **GROW is Layer 2**
  (seeded aged state under a controlled clock — the cheapest layer that can falsify
  retention boundaries).
- **Blocked cells (all named at their cells, none silent):** F-PT-012 (CF-J14-S
  execute-order clause), F-PT-013 (CF-INV-002 git-push-to-default leg), F-PT-014
  (CF-SM-GRANT scope-mapping clause), F-PT-015/F-PT-016 (CF-B14-* re-run +
  publish-origin clauses) — opened at Wave-1 implementation 2026-07-31; F-PT-006 (CF-J10-I,
  CF-SM-EVENT-*, CF-B13-*; contract-matrix remainder CF-C-B13), F-PT-008
  (CF-J06-I, CF-B09a-*; contract-matrix remainder CF-C-B09A), B-17-L3 (CF-J17-A,
  CF-B17-*; contract-matrix remainder CF-C-B17).
  <!-- changelog 2026-07-31 (audit AUD-106): §5 per-ID resolver's five blocked
  contract-matrix remainders added to this roll-up so it is the complete register. -->
  <!-- ratification 2026-07-31: F-PT-003 (CF-J07-I), F-PT-004 (CF-J04-I/CF-B15-*
  in-cell + CF-C-B15 remainder), and F-PT-007 (CF-B14-* + CF-C-B14 remainder) left
  this register — ratified; their cells now encode the ratified contracts
  (HB-P1/HB-P2/HB-P4). -->
- **Every family lands at the cheapest layer that can falsify it** (rule 12): L3
  appears only where boundary-map honest-fake verdicts left a named remainder; L4 only
  for statistical quality (L4Q); **L5 holds the obligations defined by their question
  — contention, soak, rotation, abuse — regardless of rig technology** (retention
  growth is falsifiable at L2 and lands there).

Matrix closure reached: no silent empty cell. The catalog is maintained under the
case-derivation grammar for the life of the product (sourcing channels, agents-md
contribution).
